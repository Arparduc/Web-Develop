    <h1>Pulp Fiction</h1>
    <p>Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Samuel L. Jackson, ‘Pulp Fiction’  follows the mission of two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch Coolidge is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next fight. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are a couple of young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue.
